# devpad api client

type-safe api client for devpad built with typescript and bun. this is a proxy client that communicates with the astro api routes in the main devpad application.

## features

- full typescript support with runtime validation via zod
- integration tests against actual astro api endpoints
- simple local development and testing
- proxies requests to the real devpad api routes
- fast test execution with clear separation of concerns

## prerequisites

- [bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime

## quick start

```bash
# install
bun install

# run unit tests (no external dependencies)
make test

# run integration tests (against astro server)
make integration-test
```

## architecture

this api client is a **type-safe proxy** for the astro api routes located in `app/src/pages/api/v0/`. it does not include its own server implementation.

### api routes proxied
- `GET /api/v0` - api status
- `GET /api/v0/projects` - list projects  
- `GET /api/v0/projects?id=<id>` - get project by id
- `GET /api/v0/projects?name=<name>` - get project by name
- `GET /api/v0/tasks` - list tasks
- `GET /api/v0/tasks?id=<id>` - get task by id
- `GET /api/v0/tasks?project=<id>` - get tasks by project
- `GET /api/v0/tasks?tag=<id>` - get tasks by tag

## testing

### unit tests
- command: `make test` or `bun test:unit`
- tests individual functions without external dependencies
- focuses on logic, validation, and type safety
- located in `tests/unit/`

### integration tests  
- command: `make integration-test`
- starts a real astro dev server
- creates test user and api key
- tests against actual api endpoints
- located in `tests/integration/`

### test architecture
- clear separation between unit and integration tests
- unit tests require no external dependencies
- integration tests run against the full astro application
- fresh test database for each integration test run

## development commands

```bash
# run unit tests
make test
bun test:unit

# run integration tests
make integration-test
bun test:integration

# type checking
bun check

# install dependencies
bun install
```

## usage

```typescript
import { DevpadApiClient } from './src';

const client = new DevpadApiClient({
  base_url: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v0',
  api_key: 'your-api-key-here'
});

// projects
const projects = await client.projects.list();
const project = await client.projects.create({
  project_id: 'my-project',
  name: 'my project',
  owner_id: 'user-123',
  visibility: 'PRIVATE',
  status: 'DEVELOPMENT'
});

// tasks
const tasks = await client.tasks.list({ project_id: project.id });
const task = await client.tasks.create({
  title: 'new task',
  owner_id: 'user-123',
  project_id: project.id,
  priority: 'HIGH'
});
```

## available endpoints

### projects
- `GET /api/v0/projects` - list all projects
- `POST /api/v0/projects` - create new project
- `GET /api/v0/projects/:id` - get specific project

### tasks
- `GET /api/v0/tasks` - list all tasks (with filtering)
- `POST /api/v0/tasks` - create new task
- `GET /api/v0/tasks/:id` - get specific task

### query parameters
- `project_id` - filter tasks by project (tasks endpoint)

## performance

- unit tests: ~20ms execution time
- integration tests: ~50ms execution time
- server startup: ~2s for integration test server
- api response time: <100ms per operation

## troubleshooting

### tests failing
```bash
# check if server is already running on port 8080
lsof -ti:8080

# kill any existing server
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9

# run tests again
make integration-test
```

### database issues
```bash
# clean up test databases
rm -f test.db ../../test.db

# run migration manually
cd ../.. && bun run app/scripts/debug-migrations.ts
```

### import/type issues
- ensure all dependencies are installed: `bun install`
- check typescript configuration is correct
- verify database schema types are up to date

## guidelines

### code style
- **snake_case** for variables and database fields
- **camelCase** for functions and methods
- **PascalCase** for classes and types
- environment-based configuration for test vs. production modes
- real integration testing over complex mocking
- type safety first - leverage typescript and zod throughout

### development principles
- simplicity over complexity - remove unnecessary abstractions
- real over mocked - use actual api calls for integration testing
- fast feedback - quick test execution and clear error messages
- maintainability - easy to understand and modify code
- type safety - comprehensive typescript coverage with runtime validation

### adding new features
1. write tests first - start with failing tests for new functionality
2. update types - ensure typescript types are updated for new data structures
3. real integration testing - test against actual server endpoints
4. error handling - consider failure cases and add appropriate error types
5. documentation - update todo.md with new capabilities and decisions

### code quality standards
- 100% typescript coverage - no `any` types without justification
- comprehensive error handling - all failure paths should be handled
- clear variable names - use descriptive names following naming conventions
- minimal dependencies - only add dependencies that provide significant value
- security first - never commit secrets, validate all inputs

### testing standards
- unit tests for individual functions and classes
- integration tests for full api workflows
- both happy path and error scenarios
- environment variables for configuration
- clean test data - each test should clean up after itself

## documentation

- [`todo.md`](./todo.md) - development roadmap
- [`src/types/`](./src/types/) - typescript api definitions
- tests provide comprehensive usage examples

production ready - all core functionality implemented and tested with comprehensive integration test coverage.
