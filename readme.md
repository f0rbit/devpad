This project is a set of tools for development and project management. Originally this project had a pretty large scope, attending to cover every tool you would ever need: a todo list, project planner, diary, calendar, work & assignment manager, invoice generator etc. However, in my blog post [devpad rescope](https://forbit.dev/blog/dev/rescoping-devpad), I go into detail how the project got away from it's fundamental original idea - a way for me to track all the lost `@todo` and `// TODO:` comments in my projects. So, we're starting fresh, with a small plan for a redesign outlined in another post [devpad redesign](https://forbit.dev/blog/dev/devpad-redesign).

## Main Features
- Project Management
    - Export to an API for external data fetching
    - Manage descriptions & specifications
    - Assign goals & milestones for todo tasks
    - Project versioning and automatic updates based on reaching goals
    - Tech stack information, project status
    - Update / revision history
- Todo Tracker
    - Searches codebase for todo items
    - Presents management options for each
    - Allows for additional tasks
    - API for exporting to external data sources

## Design Goals
Hyper-minimalist user interface. If something is there, it needs a clear purpose, otherwise it's clutter and unneccesary.
This will also help new users, as the interface shouldn't be overwhelming. And I think it has a nice artistic taste and fulfills a niche within the digital ocean.
