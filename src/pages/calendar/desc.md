The calendar app is simply basic.
- pulls data from work/school and fills in class times/working times
- holds birthdays
    - has space for storing birthday gift ideas / plans
- contact list
- reminders
- tickets (for festivals etc)
    - links to a list of contacts who are also going
    - holds tickets (pdf, png, or url)

This will require the `manager` to be completed first.
