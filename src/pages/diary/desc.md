The Diary has some core functionalities
- Shows TODO task completions
- Will show project finish / expected times
    - Will track consistency and commitment
- School/Work assignments or jobs
- Other Events imported from the calendar
- Reminders
- Journal entries (emotion tracking etc)
- Git commit history
- Media timeline

The above are listed in implementation priority. A new version number would
be appropiate for each feature. (ie v1 = TODO task completions, v2 = project finish /expected times, v3 = school work and jobs, v4 imports from calendar & reminders, v5 = Journal entries, v6 = git commit history timeline, v7 = media timeline)

This project should be the last to complete.
